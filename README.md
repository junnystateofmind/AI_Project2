Report:  (1) Designing a Suitable Model for UCF101 Action Recognition and the Reasoning Behind It.

(2) Model Performance and Result Analysis.

You are allowed to use chatGPT, but model modifications must be made with the goal of improving the performance of the generated model, and comparative analysis must also be included.

Dataset: UCF101: https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php#Results_on_UCF101 (외부 사이트로 연결합니다.)

Grading Criteria:

Difficulty level of implementing the model
Depth and quality of analysis presented in the report (maximum 3 pages)
Model's performance on the selected dataset
Note:

While there are no programming language restrictions, Python is recommended.
Transfer learning is not allowed.
PLAGIARISM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED: Please be aware that copying assignments will result in a score of 0, so ensure to submit your work thoughtfully.
